The objective is to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each other; that is no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or on the same diagonal. For example:\n\n![8 Queens Puzzle](https://elm-exercises.netlify.app/images/8-queens-puzzle.png)        \n        \nRepresent the positions of the queens as a list of numbers 1..N.
