The objective is to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each other; that is no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or on the same diagonal. For example:\n\n![8 Queens Puzzle](/images/8-queens-puzzle.png)        \n        \nRepresent the positions of the queens as a list of numbers 1..N. Example: [4,2,7,3,6,8,5,1] means that the queen in the first column is in row 4, the queen in the second column is in row 2, etc.\n","difficulty":"Hard","title":"The \"Eight queens puzzle\"","ellieId":"dFdF4NRQPVSa1","id":90}
